# Cryptocurrencies

## Overview of the Analysis:
A senior manager for the Advisory Services Team at Accountability Accounting, one of your most important clients, is interested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers. The company,  however, is lost in the vast universe of cryptocurrencies. So, theyâ€™ve asked you to create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment.

The data is not ideal, so it will need to be processed to fit the machine learning models. Since there is no known output for that is being looked for, we will be using unsupervised learning. To group the cryptocurrencies, we have decided on a clustering algorithm and visualize to share our findings with the board.
## Resources:
